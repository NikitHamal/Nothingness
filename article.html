                <p>Thought is a movement in time and space. It is the response of memory, experience, and knowledge stored in the brain. But can thought, which is always old, ever understand something new, something that is happening now?</p>

                <p>The mind is constantly seeking security through thought, through beliefs, through systems. But in this very search for security, it creates division, conflict, and therefore insecurity. Can we see this fact without trying to change it, without trying to do something about it?</p>

                <h2>The Nature of Thought</h2>
                <p>Thought is always fragmentary because it is the response of memory. Memory is always old, and therefore thought is always old. When thought tries to understand something new, it can only understand it in terms of the old. Therefore, thought can never understand what is new, what is fresh.</p>

                <p>We have relied on thought to solve all our problems - psychological, social, and religious. But thought itself is the problem. Thought creates the problem and then tries to solve it. This is the endless cycle of conflict.</p>

                <h2>Beyond Thought</h2>
                <p>Is there a way of looking that is not the movement of thought? Can there be pure observation without the interference of thought? When there is such observation, there is direct perception, insight.</p>

                <p>This insight is not the result of thought, not the outcome of analysis or logic. It is immediate perception of 'what is' without the screen of thought. In this perception, there is complete understanding and therefore complete action.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    "The ending of thought is the beginning of wisdom."
                </blockquote>

                <h2>The Art of Observation</h2>
                <p>Can we observe our thoughts without trying to change them, without judging them as good or bad? This observation itself brings about a transformation in the quality of thinking. It is not thought trying to change thought.</p>

                <p>When there is pure observation, thought naturally comes to an end. Not through any form of suppression or control, but through understanding. This understanding is not intellectual understanding, but direct perception.</p>
